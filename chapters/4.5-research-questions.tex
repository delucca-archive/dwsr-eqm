\subsection{Research questions}
\label{subsec:research-questions}

In this section, I present the research questions I aim to answer in this study.
The research questions are divided into different categories, including:
(i) feasibility,
(ii) accuracy,
(iii) and applicability.
Table~\ref{tab:research-questions} summarizes the research questions and their respective categories.
