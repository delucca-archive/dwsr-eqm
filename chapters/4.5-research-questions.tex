\subsection{Research questions}
\label{subsec:research-questions}

\EB{Talvez faça mais sentido juntar esta e a próxima seção e chamá-las de Research questions and methodology}
In this section, I present the research questions I aim to answer in this study. 
The research questions are divided into different categories, including:
(i) feasibility,
(ii) accuracy,
(iii) and applicability.
Table~\ref{tab:research-questions} summarizes the research questions and their respective categories.
