\section{Research proposal}
\label{sec:research-proposal}

In this research proposal, I aim to explore how to predict the memory footprint of a single algorithm.
As seen in section~\ref{sec:related-work}, while there have been numerous studies on historical analysis of memory usage to predict resource requirements, they are most from the scheduler perspective.
There is a significant gap in research when it comes to predicting memory usage of a single algorithm, specially focusing on data parallelism optimization.
