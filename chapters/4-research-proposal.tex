\section{Research proposal}
\label{sec:research-proposal}

In this research proposal, I aim to predict computer memory consumption from an algorithmic perspective.
As seen in section~\ref{sec:related-work}, while there have been numerous studies on historical analysis of memory usage to predict resource requirements from the scheduler perspective, there is a significant gap in research when it comes to predicting memory usage of a single specific algorithm.
