\section{Research proposal}
\label{sec:research-proposal}

In this research proposal, we aim to predict computer memory consumption from an algorithmic perspective.
While there have been numerous studies on memory usage history analysis from the scheduler perspective, we believe that there is a significant gap in research when it comes to predicting memory usage of a specific algorithm.
