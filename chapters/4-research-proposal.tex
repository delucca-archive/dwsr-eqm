\section{Research proposal}
\label{sec:research-proposal}

In this research proposal, I aim to propose a new data partitioning strategy that is aware of the algorithm memory footprint.
As seen in section~\ref{sec:related-work}, while there have been numerous studies on historical analysis of memory usage to predict resource requirements from the scheduler perspective, there is a significant gap in research when it comes to predicting memory usage of a single algorithm. \EB{Seria bom ter uma coluna na tabela que deixa evidente este gap}
