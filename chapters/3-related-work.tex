\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

In this section I will discuss the existing research related to this proposal.
Most of the existing work aiming to predict the memory consumption are focused on resource-aware scheduling.
The most common use-case for this type of research is to predict memory consumption in order to efficiently allocate resources in a cluster.
There are a few works that focus on resource-aware execution, most of those focused entirely on a extremely specific use-case.

During this section I will discuss both approaches, comparing and contrasting the current state-of-the-art of each.
I will also discuss the main differences between the proposed work and the existing research.
Finally, I present a comparison table that summarizes my main findings.
