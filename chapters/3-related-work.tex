\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

This section will discuss the existing research related to this proposal.
Most existing work aiming to predict memory consumption focuses on \emph{resource-aware scheduling}.
The most common use case for this research type is to predict memory consumption to allocate resources in a cluster efficiently.
There are a few works that focus on \emph{resource-aware execution}, most of those focused entirely on some particular use cases.

This section compares and contrasts the current state-of-the-art of each existing approach, evaluating the main differences between the proposed work and the existing research.
Finally, by the end of this section, table~\ref{tab:related-work-comparison} summarises the main findings.
